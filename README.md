# Acquisition Platform

This GUI developped in Python helps to configure the keysight device and its different sensors. 
Starting the acquisition will retrieve the data and give a real time plot and real time table.
The measurements can be paused, resumed and stopped at any time. All the data is then saved in a
csv or xlsx file with the filename provided by the user.

## Configure the sensors

## Save the configuration for later uses

## Change the filename
